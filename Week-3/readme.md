# Hello World Review

## This Weeks Work!
The work i did this week was to create a yellow canvas with black wording saying "Hello World!"

## Steps!
My first step was to create my functions in my sketch which i did incorrectly at first, the "{}" symbol was in the wrong place for the text to show and with trial and error I figured it out.

After that i had to fix my directory because it was recieving a 404 error, but my error was just a capital letter which i fixed and it worked.

## Help!

I discussed the class and assignments with Joleen who is also in the class in person. We discussed connecting to github and the coding we dealt with for this assignment.
