# my final
So I had a lot of trouble, I have three sketches all attached all tried different ways and all not working.

## my journey
I started by trying to use seperate JS files but that didn't work. I then switched to all in one JS file and my classes and that didn't work. Then i downgraded what I wanted to do to try and get something to work and still it wont. I have worked on it for a while and I probably should have asked for help, I think that was my problem. But regardless, three sketches are attached all failed and I feel like I am so close. I am disappointed in myself and in what I was able to do for the project.
