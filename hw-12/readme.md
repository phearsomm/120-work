# This week in work!

I was sick this week so i didnt get to spend as much time on this.

I created a mouth on the cursor and bubbles for it to eat! the bubbles are all different colors and move upwards faster if smaller.

## my troubles

When i did the class for the mouth originally i wanted it to be a stationary square with teeth but i couldn't figure out how to do that so to compromise i put a series of circles to signify an open mouth over the curser.

### this was a hard week and i am so sick
