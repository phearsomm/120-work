["Hellow World!" Sketch](https://phearsomm.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

This week i started a sketch twice, one to be introduced to the code and the second time to be the official homework. I used the function setup, draw, and background commands to create a 800 by 250 yellow square with "Hello World!" inside. I ran into no problems. I learned that color can be specified by specific words or numbers using the 255x255 color coding a.k.a. 8bit color.
