# Creating ME!

This week I sketched a self portrait using code by;

- Creating shapes using the quad, triangle, ellipse, arc, rect, and line drawings. 
- Vary the colors of my piece using color picker and an RGB code system.
- Vary the order of shapes in order to create a cohesive image.

## THE SHAPES!

The shapes I created using code were also created on a similar grid in photoshop so i could use the points as reference for the shape building. Photoshop was also used as a reference tool for color.

### The shapes i used are as follows;

##### Quad- Main use to create shape because it can create non parallel shapes.
example Quadrilateral shape with 4 coordinates for each corner.

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
quad(1, 1, 20, 1, 20, 20, 1, 20);```

##### Triangle- used a lot for the arms.

example code for a triangle

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
triangle(10, 1, 20, 20, 1, 20);```

##### Ellipse- Used for head and eyes

example code for Ellipse

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
Ellipse(20, 20, 10, 10);```

##### Line- used for a crease in the pants

example code for a line.

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
line(1, 1, 20, 1);```

##### ARC- used for part of the WHAT

example of arc CODE

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
(50, 50, 40, 40, PI, TWO_PI);```

##### Rect- used a couple times for the jacket pocket and beanie.

example code of rect

```
stroke('rgb(0, 0, 0)');
fill('(0, 0, 0)');
rect(1, 20, 50, 15, 10);

Roundness is at the end of the rect code.```

### COLORS!

I used a variety of colors but the main colors i went with where as follows;

##### RED!
example red CODE
```
fill('rgb(95,23, 40)');```

##### YELLOW!

```
fill('rgb(204, 182, 76)');```

##### GREEN!

```
fill('rgb(79, 116, 67)');```

## The order
The order of everything was the hardest for me, I had to do several fixes of the order of code.

One example of an issue was with the arms, I;

1. Created the arms after the body overlaying them all on top of the body.
2. The arm on the left side of the portraight went over the body and created odd lines that disrupted the image.
3. I separate the arm coding from arm in the front of the body and arm in the back in order to avoid any color overlays that were not congruent with the desired image.

### Due to late illness I have not posted for help on the forum as I have been resting a lot and doing worm quickly alone. I have also had no issues completing this assignment and enjoyed the puzzle.
