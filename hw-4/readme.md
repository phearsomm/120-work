# Homework! Week 4!
This week I created a bird monster!!!

## Problems I had
1. I had thought using the quad code was best but it ended up not working until i stopped and used two triangles instead.
2. Several times throughought I lost a shape or the screen went blank but that just required a steady look over the code.

## How I did it
I did the whole project in shape clusters, the tail and head feathers, body, head and eyes, beak. From there I just used a grid and translated where my pieces would be.
