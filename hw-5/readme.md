# The Animation!
This week on my sketch i had to create a design using code as well as force it to move and interact with the viewer.

## The Fun!
  The best park about this was thinking of how it should all interact inside my sketch. I quickly decided I wanted a design focused around the mouse. Once the decision was made I started coding.

# The Problems
Throughought the process my sketch stopped working an inumerable amount of times, for many reasons.

- My translate commands sometimes were placed after important information like stroke and fill.
- For a while during the beginning I couldn't figure out how to make the fill nonexistent. It was actually a pretty boneheaded mistake that took some time to realize. I had the code down as ``` fill(nofill);``` instead of ``` nofill(); ```
- The last issue I had during this was coding adventure was the expanding circle in the back. For some reason I thought the last value in the ``` ellipse( 0, 0, 0, 0); ``` was to control opacity (a misunderstanding of alpha) and couldn't understand the change in color.

####Over all this was a very fun assignment and i learned quite a bit during.
