# Algorithmical
this week i was very ill so i just finished the project. It was really interesting to play with because the variables were so finecky my sketch stopped working more than half the time i was editing it. Very fun project.

I knew i wanted to play with color and size so i decided to randomly change the location size and color of two separate rings.
