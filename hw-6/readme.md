# This week
I had a lot of fun doing this project, the variables are very cool to play with and it was interesting to see it start to grow.

## troubles
throughout i lost the screen a lot, i was having issues getting my colors for my triangles to change colors for a while but inevitably fixed only to make everything stop working when i tried to make the screen able to be fullscreen. And it was just a mispell of the word function haha

## In the end
I learned quite a few things, the modulo is very useful as is map the map.
